####Thanks to my friend @MortyTech for sharing this piece of code and his help
###Extend and grow Linux partition and filesystem
it should be use fdisk /dev/sda or vda  and delete and recreate partition or instead install 
cloud-utils-growpart package for growpart commands
the syntax is correct ! don't touch it ! ðŸ˜„


    sudo growpart /dev/sda 1
    sudo resize2fs /dev/sda1


in this following example

| /dev/vda2        | LVM PhysicalVolume |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| centos           | LVM VolumeGroup    |
| /dev/centos/root | LVM LogicalVolume  |

for LVM partition and filesystem extending you can use fdisk if growpart command is not installed  

    growpart /dev/vda 2
    
    pvresize -v /dev/vda2
    
    lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/centos/root
    
    xfs_growfs /dev/centos/root OR resize2fs /dev/centos/root

you can remain 2% of FreeSpace of VolumeGroup for Snapshots  then :


    lvextend -l +98%FREE /dev/centos/root
